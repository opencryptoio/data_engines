A world-class tech conference like TechCrunch Disrupt â€” coming to you live and in person in San Francisco on October 18-20 â€” doesnâ€™t just happen. Itâ€™s an all-hands-on-deck situation, and we want to direct your attention to an essential group of deck hands â€” our partners.

Building a startup is no easy task â€” not exactly a newsflash, we know. One of the things our partners do best is provide their expertise and educational resources. They present sessions on a range of topics that help new founders gain the confidence they need to move forward and build a solid business foundation.

Partners dispense valuable insight from our stages, and theyâ€™re always interested in engaging with interesting startups and looking for potential opportunities.

I love Disrupt because it features incredible companies. My work exposes me to lots of companies all over the world but, inevitably, I run across startups at Disrupt I havenâ€™t heard of yet. Itâ€™s always fascinating to explore opportunities and find ways to work together. â€” Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars.

Look whoâ€™s coming to Disrupt:

As previously shared, our title sponsor, AT&T, will be hosting a session on the TC+ Stage on driving innovation through collaborations both big and small. Canâ€™t wait to hear this talk!

Also on the TC+ Stage, blockchain platform Polygon will host a partner session that will knock your socks off on all things sustainable blockchain.

Bringing their amazing group of startups, Ukraine will be hosting a startup pavilion in the expo hall.

And rounding out the show floor, weâ€™re excited to share that JustIdea, Supersmart sp. z o.o. and Web Spiders will be demoing on the show floor.

TechCrunch Disrupt takes place in San Francisco on October 18-20. Buy your pass now, and take advantage of the many benefits our partners bring to the startup table.

This program is supported by world-leading industrial teams such as CEVT, Ericsson, Polestar, Veoneer, Volvo Cars, Volvo Group and Zenseact. To be included in the program, every start-up needs to be approved by at least two partners after sharing its proof-of-concept and technical details.

Minima is set to fuel a decentralized global network of devices and cars acting as autonomous economic units. Minima will guarantee the security of the network and the integrity of its data structures.

Hugo Feiler, CEO at Minima, shared that he is excited by the opportunity to participate in this program and demonstrate the latest developments of peer-to-peer IoT products:

We're thrilled to be part of the MobilityXlab program and can't wait to demonstrate the benefits of a truly decentralised network for mobility more broadly, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication in particular. When each car is a fully sovereign, functional node on the network, communication between them becomes more secure and resilient which we believe to be crucial for any future that involves autonomous vehicles.

Collaboration to kick off in August

Katarina Brud, director of MobilityXlab, highlights the importance of collaboration between all elements of the program required to push the barriers of progress:

To keep up with the rapid pace of innovation and technology development, companies can't rely on doing it on their own anymore. Our role is to foster access to a productive collaboration network for all parts involved.

As per the roadmap shared, Minima will start contributing to MobilityXlab products in August 2022. Its nodes ecosystem will provide a reliable technical basis for rapid and cheap vehicle-to-vehicle communication.

As covered by U.Today previously, Minima's technical design allows users to turn smartphones into blockchain nodes. After a $6.5 million funding round, it accomplished the 7,000 node milestone in Q4, 2021./n==============================================================================================================================================================
