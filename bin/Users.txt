Border-crossing transactions like the ones in JP Morgan's test run can be costly and slow. Using a traditional wire transfer, it could take up to five days before the 100,000 Singaporean dollars (worth roughly $72,100) reached Japan, with transaction fees skimming $330 off the top. In the JP Morgan experiment, Polygon's transaction fees for the same transfer worked out to $0.23. The money reached the Japanese target bank in minutes. What's not to love about a system that wipes out transaction fees and sends money nearly instantaneously?

Banking giant JP Morgan also announced on November 2 that it successfully executed its first-ever cross-border transaction using decentralized finance ( DeFi ) on the layer-2 network Polygon blockchain. JPMorgan said it used Polygon to conduct its first live trade (worth around $71,000) on the blockchain technology, marking a crucial step toward integrating crypto assets into traditional financial frameworks.

These predictions notably contrast with the growing adoption of the Polygon network, which earlier this week was used by multinational banking giant JPMorgan to execute the bank’s first-ever trade using decentralized finance on a public blockchain.

He: Yes, exactly. So, when you really understand how the wallet gets the gas credit, and then when you connect to non-cryptocurrency chains, it’s exactly the same as when you’re using those public chains like Ethereum, Polygon, Cosmos. Call the APIs, how to deploy smart contracts, how to call them and how to execute transactions. They’re exactly the same. So if you go through our user manual when you reach ‘how to use those chains,’ it goes back to the Ethereum user menu.

New Delhi: Crypto tokens found some lost ground on Thursday ahead of the much-awaited Jackson Hole Symposium.After plunging late last week, bitcoin and ether traded sideways. Along with the cues from the US Fed, 'The Merge'' in Ethereum is much awaited by the crypto traders.Ethereum rose more than 3 per cent, whereas Solana gained 2 per cent. Polygon, BNB and Tron were marginally down.The global cryptocurrency market cap was trading at the $1.04 trillion mark, rising about 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volume dropped more than 7 per cent close to $65.46 billion.Commenting on RBI Governor's remarks on crypto, Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder of Mudrex said RBI's stance on cryptocurrencies has always been a little rigid since 2018. But cryptos are capable of creating a more transparent environment for making transactions using blockchain, he said."It can help small investors to make transactions with lower fees in a secured manner. Cryptocurrencies can aid in diversifying portfolios from traditional assets. They can also hedge against inflation in times of financial crisis," he added.ETC is the native token of Ethereum Classic, Ethereum’s hard fork, which uses smart contracts to host and support decentralized applications on its network. ETC is currently trading at $36.2, up by 8% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum’s upcoming Merge seems to have rekindled the interest in ETC as an alternative for miners.After successfully breaking above the downward trendline resistance earlier in August and reaching a peak of $45.68, ETC started creating a series of lower highs. It plunged below the trendline in a steep fall but has now flipped the trendline resistance into support. However, the token is far from reaching its August highs.While ETC’s prospects seem to be improving a bit, a clear indication of a trend reversal is missing. It needs to break above the psychological resistance of $37 to gather further momentum. The next resistance would be the .618 fib level at $40, though its technical indicators present a neutral-to-buy signal. In case of a downturn, the .236 fib level of $34.6 will act as immediate support.Resistance: $37.0, $40.0Support: $34.6, $31.0

Once referred as ' Ethereum Killer ' by the crypto fanatics, Solana has been hit hard in the latest crypto winter. However, the blockchain network is buzzing over its latest ecosystem exploit which has wiped off tokens worth millions.Users have reported that their funds have been drained out without their knowledge and the latest hack has been on the 'hot' wallets which are connected to the internet including Phantom, Slope and TrustWallet.The attacker somehow obtained the ability to sign (initiate and approve) transactions on the behalf of users, suggesting a trusted third-party service may have been compromised in a so-called supply chain attack.Following the hack, Solana plunged about 10 per cent to $38.28 level on Wednesday. However, the volumes rose 75 per cent as the tokens worth $1.91 billion exchanged hands in the last 24 hours, the coinmarketcap data suggested.However, the quantum of drained funds is not confirmed yet and it is reported the attack is not over either. Several addresses linked to Solana have been attacked.Sathvik Vishwanath Co-Founder, CEO Unocoin said that Solana is a blockchain with its own token, that works as the gas to confirm the transactions on that blockchain, witnessing numerous hack attempts on the wallets supporting this token."A recent successful attempt drained away about $560 million worth of Solana from various user wallets and this has sent shivers in the Solana ecosystem" he added. "A part of the reaction is the decreased prices of the token."According to experts, this is an opportunity to also remind investors to access the health of the crypto ecosystem. Solana has faced outage issues in the past.The initial signals point to compromised keys which are evident by the digital footprints which are apparently signed by the respective owners, said Prashant Kumar, Founder, weTrade."Solana and the other cryptocurrencies have been generally moving upward for last few weeks. However the hacking news led to price erosion first but it has partly restored the lost value since then," he added.Market participants said it's unfortunate that Solana's ecosystem is breached and the exact reason is yet now known. It is speculated that the compromise is at the end of a third-party service provider.Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus Crypto Platform said that 8,000 wallets have been compromised from internet-connected hot wallets and the attacker seems to have wrongfully secured the mandate to ‘initiate and approve’ transactions.The latest attack has reignited the long running around the security of hot wallets, which stay connected to the internet at all times in order to provide users a convenient way to send, store, and receive crypto.Cold wallets – USB drives that must be plugged into a computer to sign transactions – are heralded as a more secure, albeit less convenient, alternative.This brings to fore the question regarding the security of the ‘perpetually-connected-to-the-internet’ hot wallets which allow easier ways to send, receive and transact crypto, said Subburaj."The prudent thing for customers, investors, and traders would be to switch to trusted exchanges which provide additional, multiple layers of safety. They could also use hard wallets and avoid using third-party wallets," he added.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.
