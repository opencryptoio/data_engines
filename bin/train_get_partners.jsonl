{Text to analyze: ## Polygon ## .The resulting buzz has not only pushed up the price of Polygon’s MATIC token and built up the biz-dev reputation of Polygon Studios and CEO Ryan Wyatt, but the early results of these projects are also telling. Reddit said recently that its users created more than 3 million Polygon wallets to claim a free NFT avatar, generating momentum around them and the broader crypto space..Wyatt told Decrypt that when he joined Polygon Studios in February—following several years leading YouTube’s Gaming vertical—he saw a need to bring in more people with traditional web and brand experience to pair with the highly technical, Web3-savvy builders already in the space. “I wanted to fill that gap,” he said..“With Web2 [companies], the impact is bigger and the implications are always bigger for those partners, because they're navigating the space for the first time,” Wyatt explained. “And so they are being very strategic in the way that they're doing it. They want to talk through it. That's a little bit of a different experience.”###END###Which companies are partnering or collaborating with Polygon?:  Reddit END ###END###}
{Text to analyze: ## Polygon ## .Whether it’s a Web2 brand or a crypto upstart, Wyatt said that his team’s goal is largely the same: understand the prospective partner’s Web3 vision, convince them that Polygon is the ideal platform to build it on, and then provide support to bring that vision to life..Bringing together experienced big tech veterans with Web3 natives who “live and breathe this space” yields a group at Polygon Studios that can help Web2 brands get over the hump and embrace NFTs and decentralized models, Wyatt said. “It’s kind of like the secret sauce of the team,” he added..Polygon is having a moment right now with mainstream brand adoption, but Wyatt admits that what he sees as the Studios team’s advantage over rival scaling solutions like Immutable X and Arbitrum might not last.###END###Which companies are partnering or collaborating with Polygon?:  No partnership or collaboration found END ###END###}

{Text to analyze: ## Polygon ## .He doesn’t believe that the fallout from FTX’s downfall will directly affect brands looking to build and experiment in Web3. If anything, he said, the damage and contagion show how essential decentralized protocols are, rather than traditional, centralized platforms..“Ultimately, a lot of this stuff is solved in a real world that's decentralized,” he said. “If you think of where these problems are happening, they're centralized exchanges and intermediaries into Web3, right? When you start to see a world that's decentralized, that's easier to use and has been built, then I think you get away from all of this stuff.”.Wyatt teased more partners to come, suggesting continued brand momentum. But he’s also keen to encourage more Web3-native builders to develop tools for the Polygon ecosystem, such as wallets, marketplaces, and on-ramps, and emphasize decentralized finance (DeFi) building in an industry that just learned a tough lesson about centralized entities.###END###Which companies are partnering or collaborating with Polygon?:  No partnership or collaboration found END ###END###}

As a scalable, blockchain-based solution, Token Events brings together fans, entertainers, and venues to reimagine the beleaguered live events industry and will rely on Polygon for its proprietary Non-Fungible Experiences, NFT collectibles, and $FAN rewards going forward.While considering which blockchain to choose for its infrastructure, Token Events prioritized optimal transaction speed and cost, security, interoperability, support, sustainability, and inclusivity–all areas in which Polygon excels.“Token Events is designed to easily integrate with a wide array of sports organizations and venues. As such, we need to anticipate explosive growth and be prepared to scale accordingly; by leveraging Polygon, we can ensure that these demands are met. While our own unique company and user requirements dictate our tech selection, it’s certainly inspiring to build a community alongside some of the largest consumer brands in the world,” noted Token Events CEO Adam Jones.As the most forward-thinking business oriented toward the complete digital transformation of the live event space, Token Events revolutionizes fan commerce by collecting consensual data and serving cost-neutral analytics to venues, event producers, and brands. As such, it is designed to alleviate exorbitant fees, streamline operations, increase engagement, supercharge sponsorships, and reward fans for their attention and passion.In turn, Polygon’s Proof of Stake network will facilitate the exchange of value in this unique data union. “We’re in the business of behavioral science, so it’s necessary to collaborate with a proven chain—one that can handle high-volume ticketing events, process fan data, and emit rewards reliably, quickly, and cheaply,” Jones added.“We’re excited to welcome Token Events to the Polygon family,” said Jennifer Kattula, SVP, Marketing at Polygon. “Token Events’ plug-and-play middleware makes it incredibly easy for brands to make the leap into Web3, with solutions for experiences, fans, and live events crossing a wide range of industries. It’s promising to see more Web3 experiences being brought to the live events space.”With tested technology and unparalleled support, Polygon will ensure that Token Events’ mandate to reimagine the $2trillion live entertainment economy and to make events more accessible, affordable, and enjoyable for all continues unabated.“As it stands, this industry is rife with bad actors and exploitation: from ticket brokers and pullers to artificial secondary markets. Venues, artists, and fans alike suffer from the unchecked greed of opportunists,” said Token Events COO Seth Rompelman. “Deeply entrenched interests are stifling innovation in the space, and Token Events levels the playing field as a free-market alternative to the status quo.”With an intuitive interface, simple onboarding and seamless integrations, Token was architected for ease of use and to accommodate everyone–especially non-crypto natives.“The path to Web3 is a long and winding one. While the implications of Token are massive for commerce, the tech involved is a secondary consideration for cash-strapped event attendees and businesses in an ever-crowded space,” Rompelman continues. “Blockchain projects are struggling to survive as a result of overly niche and esoteric use cases. Token solves persistent problems in an antiquated industry and creates real-world value for users in ways that aren’t contingent upon market cycles.”###About Token EventsToken Events is a blockchain-based behavioral science and loyalty reward company building the future of fandom. The Token platform focuses on a seamless experience: one that accommodates existing user needs and behaviors with intuitive design, IRL usability, and robust $FAN incentives.

{Text to analyze: ## Polygon ## .Urvit Goel, VP of global business development for gaming, Polygon, is of the opinion that games which integrate non-fungible tokens (NFTs) get the edge over traditional games which don’t allow users to sell their in-game items, according to Cointelegraph..As stated by Cointelegraph, Goel spoke in Seoul about how Polygon (MATIC) is trying to make NFT games proliferate, and why game publishers from South Korea such as Neowiz and Nixon are entering into the space. Goel also made the point that traditional business models that NFTs are comparing with may be comparatively weaker. In traditional gaming, users are able to buy in-game items through the use of actual money but those items won’t carry any re-sale value to get back any dollar. However, with majority of games in gaming finance (GameFi) area, users can buy items as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and sell them on when they are over with playing with the game. Goel emphasised on the point of referring the traditional model as “money in, money out,” due to gamers being able to take back at least some of the dollar value they had put in the game..Information from Cointelegraph stated that Goel saw clear signals of traditional game publishers gearing up for big pushes in the GameFi sector, starting with South Korea’s gaming company Nexon, which carries the MapleStory title. According to gaming news media outlet mmorpg, in June, Nexon announced that it would put a version of its flagship title on-chain as MapleStory N.

{Text to analyze: ## Solana ## .Making crypto pay A new way for people to pay with crypto, Solana Pay, is launching today. It’s one of many efforts to solve the crypto payments puzzle, from bitcoin’s Lightning Network to stablecoins. But Solana believes it has solved some of the problems that have held crypto payments back. Solana Pay is an open protocol for developers with standardized payment specifications to build on and customize, meaning merchants can connect directly or use software built by ecommerce providers, point-of-sale software makers or payments companies. Crypto payments haven’t lived up to their promise. Bitcoin and Ethereum suffer from slow speeds and high costs, and can only do a fraction of the transactions Visa and Mastercard’s centralized networks process. While the Solana network is not as big as the bitcoin blockchain or Ethereum’s network, Solana has fast transactions (65,000 per second) and a low cost (fractions of a cent per transaction)..Solana Pay also has consumer-friendly features: Users can pay in person using a QR code or online using a browser plug-in. The technology works with any Solana-compatible token: Currently, that includes its own SOL token as well as others like the USDC stablecoin..And it’s got key partners lined up: Solana Labs, which initiated the project; Checkout.com; Circle; Citcon; and digital wallets from crypto exchange FTX and Solana wallets Phantom and Slope. Solana Pay’s backers are also working on an integration with Shopify that is expected to be released soon. Cash is king — and Solana Pay is more cash-like. It’s not quite equivalent to a credit-card payment, by design. Solana Pay is meant to be a digital version of a cash payment. That’s attractive for merchants, who can avoid the costs of intermediaries such as Visa/Mastercard or the costs of chargebacks. Solana Pay transactions aren’t reversible, said Sheraz Shere, head of Payments at Solana Labs.###END###Which companies are partnering or collaborating with Solana?:  Checkout.com, Circle, Citcon, FTX, Phantom, Slope, Shopify END ###END###}

In Web3 games, NFTs have become a core technology that allows game developers and players to store in-game assets (like accessories, weapons, characters, clothing, etc.) on the blockchain. For certain in-game assets that are not 1:1 and can be redeemed in greater quantities, SFTs become a useful way to "stack" like-for-like assets in the player's inventory. For creators developing games on the blockchain, SFTs lower the amount of resources needed for players to efficiently mint and transact during gameplay. SFTs minted on Solana share a "Mint Account", which results in less storage used per asset and lower minting fees..Crystals and Terraform Seeds are among the first Genopets SFTs that will be listed on Magic Eden's marketplace. Within the game, Crystals are base layer materials used for crafting other items and players will be able to use multiple quantities of them at a time. Terraform Seeds allow players to make aesthetic customization and performance upgrades to evolve their Genopets' habitats. Traditionally, if a player sells ten Water Crystals to craft a new item or sells a number of Terraform Seeds, they would be required to sell each NFT individually. SFTs allow players to sell all ten Crystals or Terraform Seeds simultaneously and experience more efficient gameplay via one-click trading features.."We are excited to partner with Genopets to power their new SFT marketplace which will bring familiar Web2 trading mechanics to players looking to build and grow their in-game assets.

{Text to analyze: ## Polkadot ## .People who choose to hold their own cryptocurrency can store it "hot," "cold," or some combination of the two. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and allows owners relatively easy access to their coins so they can spend their crypto. The trade-off for convenience is potential exposure to bad actors. "Cold storage often refers to crypto that has been moved to wallets whose private keys — the passwords that enable the crypto to be moved out of the wallet — are not stored on internet-connected computers, so that hackers can't hack into the computer and steal the private keys," said Philip Gradwell, chief economist of Chainalysis, a blockchain data firm. Thumb drive-size devices such as a Trezor or Ledger offer a way to secure crypto tokens "cold." Square is also building a hardware wallet and service "to make bitcoin custody more mainstream." The Taihuttu family has largely relied on cold storage to safeguard their tokens for the last six years. Currently, the Taihuttus keep 27% of their crypto holdings "hot" on centralized exchanges such as Bybit, a platform Taihuttu said is transparent and backed by real assets. He also keeps some tokens on Kraken, since it is one of the oldest exchanges. He refers to this crypto stash as his "risk capital," and he uses these crypto coins for day trading and potentially precarious bets. The other 73% of the Taihuttus' total crypto portfolio is in cold storage. These cold hardware wallets, which are spread around the globe, hold bitcoin, ether and some litecoin ..Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Didi Taihuttu in a desert in Dubai. Didi Taihuttu.The family declined to say how much it holds in crypto, but they did disclose that they are shifting $1 million worth of bitcoin, ether, litecoin, polkadot, and other tokens from these hardware wallets and centralized exchanges to decentralized exchanges. Taihuttu said he ultimately wants to move 100% of the family's crypto savings into DEXs and invest 15% of their net worth into upstart DEXs since he sees these decentralized platforms as the centerpiece of the next bull run. When asked why he is going all in on DEXs instead of keeping his crypto cold, Taihuttu pointed to ease of access. DEXs allow him to connect the crypto he safeguards on thumb drives in hiding spots all over the world directly to the platform, meaning that he can make trades far more easily while still protecting his tokens. "Our capital now is really difficult to use in trading, because then I need to send my bitcoin from my ledger into an exchange," Taihuttu said. The financial privacy offered by DEXs is also a huge incentive. "You're trading from an anonymous ledger on an exchange as an anonymous entity," he said. "You get full access to non-KYC trading in a decentralized way on a DEX." Taihuttu isn't alone in shifting his focus to DEXs. Following the FTX bankruptcy, Trezor's sales revenue reportedly jumped 300% and billions of dollars in bitcoin fled exchanges. Meanwhile, Multicoin Capital, a crypto investment firm, told limited partners that 7% of its assets are similarly stored cold, in self-custodied wallets.###END###Which companies are partnering or collaborating with Polkadot?: No partnership or collaboration found END ###END###}
