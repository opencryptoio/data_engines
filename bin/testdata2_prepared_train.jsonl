{"prompt":"490 \/ Mercedes \/ Polygon \/ Polygon MATIC is one of the biggest winners in the crypto market today, with a 15 price increase over the last 24 hours. As NewsBTC reported yesterday, MATIC gave a golden cross signal on the daily chart a few days ago. The last time MATICUSD posted this significant trading signal on the daily chart, the altcoin recorded a massive rally of more than 13,000 . Related Reading MATIC On The Move After Polygon Tapped By META MATICUSD November 3, 2022 MATIC had been trading in a sideways channel since mid July. After the golden cross formed on October 20, MATIC showed small strength. However, the explosive breakout from the sideways channel was triggered by fundamentals and probably whales scooping up MATIC. After the announcement that META will use Polygon for Instagram NFTs, the price soared by more than 20 within one day and was able to overcome the 4 month high at 1.06. Unsurprisingly, after Polygon s explosive move MATIC , the RSI is currently at 75 and thus in the overbought zone. A retest of the 1.06 level would thus be healthy for the market before the rally may find a continuation. Meanwhile, on chain analysis firm Sanitment has released data showing that whales have front runned the pump. In an analysis, Santiment said that a mid October spike in Polygon holdings by 10m MATIC whales may have foreshadowed this . Regarding the recent move, Santiment said that yesterday marked the highest amount of 100k whale transactions since February for the 11th . Fundamentals of Polygon Backing A Continuation Of The MATIC Rallye Most notably, recent announcements from Instagram and JPMorgan have turned the spotlight on Polygon MATIC . However, Polygon s list of high profile partners has been growing fast recently. In particular, Meta s announcement caused a stir, as Polygon will be the very first partner in the NFT space for Instagram, as Bitcoinist reported. No less sensational, however, was JP Morgan s announcement of its first live trade worth about 71,000 on a public blockchain using Polygon.

Especially the partnership with Reddit has played a significant role in this success. However, the list of renowned Polygon partners is much longer.

{"prompt":"102 \/ Credit Suisse \/ Hyperledger \/ Security vs Cost trade off Basically, the current set up either means your blockchain is cheap but risky or expensive and secure. In bitcoin s blockchain, the integrity of the records is guaranteed by the fact that the majority of the network are signing off on each transaction more eyes are inspecting it. Bitcoin incentivises this by rewarding people with bitcoin for the job of inspecting and cryptographically sealing off the transactions. This is costly. Permissioned networks are the alternative and operate like a private members club. There s a doorman but once you re in, you can do what you want on the network. The fact that there are fewer people on the network means there s less oversight of transactions and potentially room for abuse by one of the members. Do you actually need blockchain Credit Suisse says If it ain t broke, don t fix it, for a blockchain to be relevant you must 1 require a database, 2 need shared write access, 3 have unknown writers whose interests are not unified, and 4 not trust a third party to maintain the integrity of the data. Critical mass is essential Blockchain is, after all, a network. What use is it being the first one to join if you can only really use it when there are lots of members There is some progress on this problem with various industry wide bodies, such as R3 and the Hyperledger foundation, but getting people together is one thing getting them to agree and work together is another. The input problem Pretty much the same as problem one. A blockchain is only as good as the information on it, and so far good processes haven t been developed for vetting anything other than bitcoin transactions. Vetting people who are allowed on the chain needs to be sorted too. Hackable The more people on the network, the more entry points, and the more vulnerabilities for hackers. Of course, part of blockchains appeal is that once data is logged it can t be changed but bad actors could place false trades, for example. Even proprietary data about who s trading what with who could be valuable. You have to see it to believe it Credit Suisse writes Although identity can be encrypted relatively easily on a blockchain, transaction data are not for the simple reason that nodes have to see it to verify it. This may be an issue for those concerned about data privacy. Identity problems Basically, what if you lose the private key that unlocks ownership of a specific asset registered on the blockchain Credit Suisse The issue with bearer instruments is you can lose them cash being the most salient example. A better solution to reconciling on and off chain identity appears necessary. The DAO attack The Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, which holds hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital currency Ethereum, was hacked in June, forcing it to fork its network to stop thieves taking more. But the problem is Ethereum, like bitcoin, is a decentralized network and so needed the consensus of the community before it could make the immediate change. Credit Suisse says The hard fork undertaken by the Ethereum community also shows that blockchains are only immutable when consensus wants them to be.   ->END","completion":" False->END"}
